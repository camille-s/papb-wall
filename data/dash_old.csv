Cash was locked in the back of the police cruiser, interrogated, threatened with arrest and held “hostage” until she provided information about the purse-snatching and led police to the house of someone they believed to be involved, according to the internal affairs report, which deemed it unconstitutional. A purse and license inside Cash’s vehicle also were taken by police, an illegal seizure, according to the investigation.
